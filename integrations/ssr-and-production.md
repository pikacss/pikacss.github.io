  Why server-side rendering needs no special handling, and what to expect from
  PikaCSS in dev and production builds.

# SSR & Production

PikaCSS output is a static CSS file produced at build time. That single fact answers most SSR and production questions.

## SSR, SSG, and Streaming Just Work

There is no runtime style injection and no style registry to flush:

* Every `pika()` call is replaced with a class-name string literal during the build — components render plain strings on the server exactly as they do in the browser.
* All generated styles live in one CSS file (`pika.gen.css` by default). The `import 'pika.css'` specifier resolves to that file, and your bundler handles it like any other stylesheet import.

So server-side rendering, static site generation, and streaming responses need no PikaCSS-specific handling: if your setup can serve a regular imported stylesheet, it can serve PikaCSS. There is no `extractCriticalToChunks`, no `ServerStyleSheet`, no hydration mismatch surface from styling.

For Nuxt specifically, the `@pikacss/nuxt-pikacss` module registers a Nuxt plugin template whose only job is `import "pika.css"` — nothing else is added to the server or client runtime. See [Nuxt](/integrations/nuxt).

## Production Builds

In build mode the plugin scans all files matched by `scan.include` up front, collects every `pika()` usage, and writes the complete CSS file before bundling continues. The output contains:

* the `@layer` order declaration,
* preflights (with unused variables and keyframes pruned),
* the deduplicated atomic classes — sized by unique declarations, not call sites (see [How PikaCSS Generates CSS](/getting-started/how-pikacss-generates-css)).

The result passes through your bundler's normal CSS pipeline (minification, hashing, code splitting) untouched by PikaCSS.

## What Triggers a Reload in Dev

The dev server re-creates the engine (and regenerates both output files) when:

* **The config file changes.** The resolved `pika.config.*` file is watched; a content change reloads the config and rebuilds the engine.
* **A config dependency changes.** Plugins that load external files register them via `engine.addConfigDependency(path)` — for example, [@pikacss/plugin-design-tokens](/official-plugins/design-tokens) registers its token source files. Those paths are watched the same way as the config file.

Both paths rely on the bundler's file watcher (esbuild is the exception — it has no watch-based reload path). Ordinary source edits do not re-create the engine; they only add or update the affected file's usages, and the generated files are rewritten only when the resolved styles actually changed.

## Type-Level Performance

The size of the generated `pika.gen.ts` (autocomplete unions, preview overloads) grows with your project. TypeScript type-system cost is tracked with an in-repo benchmark suite (`scripts/type-bench/`) that measures check time, instantiations, and IDE latency across usage scales and TS versions — so regressions in type performance are measured, not guessed. No absolute numbers are published because they depend heavily on project shape and hardware.
