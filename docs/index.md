features:
  - icon: ⚡
    title: Zero Runtime
    details: All styling work happens at build time. Your production bundle ships plain class name strings and a static CSS file — no runtime overhead.
  - icon: 🧩
    title: Atomic CSS Output
    details: Each CSS property-value pair becomes a unique, reusable atomic class. Shared styles are deduplicated automatically, keeping CSS size minimal.
  - icon: ⚙️
    title: Zero Config by Default
    details: Start with sensible defaults. PikaCSS auto-discovers or creates a config file when needed — no boilerplate required.
  - icon: 🧠
    title: Static Analyzability First
    details: Style arguments are evaluated at build time via `new Function(...)`, so they must be statically analyzable. No custom syntax to learn.
  - icon: 🤖
    title: TypeScript Auto-Completion
    details: Full typed style authoring with generated autocomplete support. CSS properties, values, selectors, and plugin-defined tokens are all type-safe.
  - icon: 🔌
    title: Universal Build Tool Support
    details: One engine across Vite, Rollup, Webpack, esbuild, Rspack, Rolldown, and Nuxt via `@pikacss/unplugin-pikacss`.
  - icon: 🎨
    title: Nested Selectors & Variants
    details: Supports pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, media queries, and custom selectors inline within your style definitions.
  - icon: 🧰
    title: Extensible Plugin System
    details: 5 built-in plugins (variables, keyframes, selectors, shortcuts, important) plus external plugins for icons, CSS resets, and typography.
