# Integration API reference

* Package: `@pikacss/integration`
* Generated from the exported surface and JSDoc in `packages/integration/src/index.ts`.
* Source files: `packages/integration/src/ctx.ts`, `packages/integration/src/index.ts`, `packages/integration/src/types.ts`

## Package summary

Build-tool integration context Re-exports the public surface of [`@pikacss/core`](/api/core).

Use [Unplugin integration](/integrations/unplugin) when you need conceptual usage guidance instead of exact symbol lookup.

## Functions

### createCtx(options) {#function-createctx-options}

Creates an `IntegrationContext` that wires together config loading, engine initialization, source file transformation, and codegen output.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `options` | `IntegrationContextOptions` | The integration configuration including paths, function name, scan globs, and codegen settings. |

**Returns:** `IntegrationContext` - A fully constructed `IntegrationContext`. Call `setup()` on the returned context before using transforms.

The context uses reactive signals internally so that computed paths (CSS and TS codegen
file paths) automatically update when `cwd` changes. The `setup()` method must be called
before any transform or codegen operations - transform calls automatically await the
pending setup promise.

## Types

### FnUtils {#interface-fnutils}

Classifier and regex utilities for recognizing all `pika()` function call variants in source code.

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `isNormal` | `(fnName: string) => boolean` | Returns `true` if the given function name is a normal call (output format determined by `transformedFormat`). | — |
| `isForceString` | `(fnName: string) => boolean` | Returns `true` if the given function name forces string output (e.g., `pika.str`). | — |
| `isForceArray` | `(fnName: string) => boolean` | Returns `true` if the given function name forces array output (e.g., `pika.arr`). | — |
| `isPreview` | `(fnName: string) => boolean` | Returns `true` if the given function name is a preview variant (e.g., `pikap`, `pikap.str`). | — |
| `RE` | `RegExp` | A compiled global regex that matches all recognized function call variants, including bracket-notation accessors. | — |

**Remarks:**

The function name is configurable via `IntegrationContextOptions.fnName`, so all
variants (`.str`, `.arr`, preview `p` suffix, bracket notation) are derived
dynamically from that base name.

### IntegrationContext {#interface-integrationcontext}

The main build-tool integration context that bridges the PikaCSS engine with bundler plugins.

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cwd` | `string` | The current working directory. Can be updated at runtime (e.g., when the project root changes). | — |
| `currentPackageName` | `string` | The npm package name of the integration consumer, used in generated file headers and module declarations. | — |
| `fnName` | `string` | The base function name recognized in source transforms (e.g., `'pika'`). | — |
| `transformedFormat` | `'string' \| 'array'` | The default output format for normal `pika()` calls: `'string'` or `'array'`. | — |
| `cssCodegenFilepath` | `string` | Absolute path to the generated CSS output file, computed from `cwd` and the configured relative path. | — |
| `tsCodegenFilepath` | `string \| Nullish` | Absolute path to the generated TypeScript declaration file, or `null` if TypeScript codegen is disabled. | — |
| `hasVue` | `boolean` | Whether the `vue` package is installed in the project, used to include Vue-specific type declarations in codegen. | — |
| `resolvedConfig` | `EngineConfig \| Nullish` | The loaded engine configuration object, or `null` if loading failed or no config was found. | — |
| `resolvedConfigPath` | `string \| Nullish` | Absolute path to the resolved config file on disk, or `null` for inline configs or when no config was loaded. | — |
| `resolvedConfigContent` | `string \| Nullish` | Raw string content of the config file, or `null` for inline configs or when no config was loaded. | — |
| `loadConfig` | `() => Promise<LoadedConfigResult>` | Loads (or reloads) the engine configuration from disk or inline source, updating `resolvedConfig`, `resolvedConfigPath`, and `resolvedConfigContent`. | — |
| `usages` | `Map<string, UsageRecord[]>` | Map from source file ID to the list of `UsageRecord` entries extracted during transforms. Keyed by the file path relative to `cwd`. | — |
| `previewUsages` | `Map<string, UsageRecord[]>` | Map from source file ID to preview-only `UsageRecord` entries (from `pikap()` calls). Only these drive TypeScript preview overload generation. | — |
| `hooks` | `{ 		styleUpdated: ReturnType<typeof createEventHook<void>> 		tsCodegenUpdated: ReturnType<typeof createEventHook<void>> 	}` | Event hooks for notifying plugins when generated outputs need refreshing. `styleUpdated` fires on CSS changes; `tsCodegenUpdated` fires on TypeScript declaration changes. | — |
| `engine` | `Engine` | The initialized PikaCSS engine instance. Throws if accessed before `setup()` completes. | — |
| `transformFilter` | `{ 		include: string[] 		exclude: string[] 	}` | Glob patterns for the bundler's transform pipeline, derived from the scan config with codegen files excluded. | — |
| `transform` | `(code: string, id: string) => Promise<{ code: string, map: SourceMap } \| Nullish>` | Processes a source file by extracting `pika()` calls, resolving them through the engine, and replacing them with computed output. Returns the transformed code and source map, or `null` if no calls were found. | — |
| `getCssCodegenContent` | `() => Promise<string \| Nullish>` | Generates the full CSS output string, including layer declarations, preflights, and all atomic styles collected from transforms. | — |
| `getTsCodegenContent` | `() => Promise<string \| Nullish>` | Generates the full TypeScript declaration content for `pika.gen.ts`, or `null` if TypeScript codegen is disabled. | — |
| `writeCssCodegenFile` | `() => Promise<void>` | Generates and writes the CSS codegen file to disk at `cssCodegenFilepath`. | — |
| `writeTsCodegenFile` | `() => Promise<void>` | Generates and writes the TypeScript codegen file to disk at `tsCodegenFilepath`. No-op if TypeScript codegen is disabled. | — |
| `fullyCssCodegen` | `() => Promise<void>` | Scans all matching source files, collects usages via transform, then writes the CSS codegen file. Used for full rebuilds. | — |
| `setupPromise` | `Promise<void> \| null` | The pending setup promise while initialization is in progress, or `null` when idle. Transform calls await this before proceeding. | — |
| `setup` | `() => Promise<void>` | Initializes (or reinitializes) the context by clearing state, loading config, creating the engine, and wiring up dev hooks. Returns a promise that resolves when setup is complete. | — |

**Remarks:**

Created via `createCtx()`. The context manages the full build lifecycle: config loading,
engine initialization, source file transformation, usage tracking, and output file generation.
All transform and codegen calls automatically await `setup()` completion before proceeding.

### IntegrationContextOptions {#interface-integrationcontextoptions}

Configuration options for creating an integration context.

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cwd` | `string` | The working directory used to resolve relative paths for config files, codegen outputs, and source scanning. | — |
| `currentPackageName` | `string` | The npm package name of the integration consumer (e.g., `'@pikacss/unplugin'`), embedded in generated file headers and import paths. | — |
| `scan` | `{ 		include: string[] 		exclude: string[] 	}` | Glob patterns controlling which source files are scanned for `pika()` calls. `include` specifies files to process; `exclude` specifies files to skip. | — |
| `configOrPath` | `EngineConfig \| string \| Nullish` | The engine configuration object, a path to a config file, or `null`/`undefined` to trigger auto-discovery of `pika.config.*` files. | — |
| `fnName` | `string` | The base function name to recognize in source code (e.g., `'pika'`). All variants (`.str`, `.arr`, preview) are derived from this name. | — |
| `transformedFormat` | `'string' \| 'array'` | Controls the default output format of normal `pika()` calls: `'string'` produces a space-joined class string, `'array'` produces a string array. | — |
| `tsCodegen` | `false \| string` | Path to the generated TypeScript declaration file (`pika.gen.ts`), or `false` to disable TypeScript codegen entirely. | — |
| `cssCodegen` | `string` | Path to the generated CSS output file (e.g., `'pika.gen.css'`). | — |
| `autoCreateConfig` | `boolean` | When `true`, automatically scaffolds a default `pika.config.js` file if no config file is found. | — |

**Remarks:**

These options are set by bundler plugin adapters (Vite, webpack, Nuxt) and are
not typically configured by end users directly.

### LoadedConfigResult {#type-loadedconfigresult}

Discriminated union representing the outcome of loading an engine configuration file.

**Remarks:**

Three shapes are possible: an inline config (no file), a successfully loaded file-based
config, or a failed/missing load (all fields `null`). The `file` and `content` fields are
populated only when the config was loaded from disk, enabling hot-reload detection.

### UsageRecord {#interface-usagerecord}

Records a single `pika()` call result, pairing the resolved atomic style IDs with the original call arguments.

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `atomicStyleIds` | `string[]` | The list of atomic CSS class names generated by the engine for this call. | — |
| `params` | `Parameters<Engine['use']>` | The original arguments passed to `engine.use()`, preserved for TypeScript codegen overload generation. | — |

**Remarks:**

Each source file may produce multiple `UsageRecord` entries — one per `pika()` call site.
These records drive both CSS output (via `atomicStyleIds`) and IDE preview overloads (via `params`).
